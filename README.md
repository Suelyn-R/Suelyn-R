## Hi, I'm Sue Lyn! 👋

🎓 **Junior at Fordham University, studying Computational Neuroscience and Bioinformatics**  
👩‍💼 **Passionate about exploring careers in the 3Bs: biotechnology, business, and beauty!**  
  While my undergraduate studies are medicine-focused, my interdisciplinary interests thrive in creative settings! I am eager to explore my diverse interests in medicine,                 technology, and bussiness with a focus on data analystics, business strategy, and market research. I am continuously developing my skills in scientific research and business            development, and I believe that genuine curiosity is the key to growth and success! I am looking to leverage my diverse skills in an internship within my 3Bs listed above and learn     from industry professionals. Any and all advice is welcome, so feel free to reach out!
  
🌱 Currently, I am a [Break Through Tech Fellow](url) building my technical and professional portfolio. This past summer, I earned a certificate in Machine Learning Foundations from the Program, and I will begin my AI Studio Project in the fall!

✨ **Fun Fact:**  
I've been a dancer for 15 years, trained in Ballet, Contemporary, and traditional Chinese Dance. I also performed FOX Show "Game of Talents" in 2021, but now I dance with Fordham University's Expressions Dance Alliance! When I'm not dancing, I love exploring new matcha cafe's or restaurants and ranking them on the Beli App. 😸
